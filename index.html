        <div class="history">A brief history of the traditional poet Nazrul Government College During the tenure of the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal, Sir George Campbell, with the approval of the Madrasa Reforms Committee, three new madrasas were established in Dhaka, Chittagong and Rajshahi in 1874 on the model of the Calcutta Alia Madrasa with the money from the Mohsin Fund.
             </div>

            <div class="history">Although the newly established madrasas were named Mohsinia Madrasas in homage to Haji Mohammad Mohsin, the madrasas established in Dhaka became widely known as Dhaka Madrasas. These were the first government educational institutions for Muslims in Bangladesh during the British rule. Earlier, in July 1873, according to a government decision, a grant of ten thousand taka was arranged for Dhaka Madrasa from the Mohsin Fund annually.

                For a long 42 years, all the expenses of Dhaka Madrasa were met from the Mohsin Fund. On November 16, 1915, a government order entrusted the responsibility of bearing the expenses of the madrasa to the Bengal government. In 1880, under the supervision of the first principal, Maulana Obaidullah Al Obaidi, the madrasa building was built according to Muslim architectural style. The building was designed by Major Mann.

                After his death, his name was engraved on a white stone plaque on the northern wooden staircase of the main building of the college by the students. The madrasa had seven classes. Only Arabic students studied in the Arabic department. English students studied in the English department (later the Anglo-Persian department). This department taught up to entrance. Students first took the entrance examination from here in 1881.

            <div class="history">
                In 1947, there were 4 classes in the Madrasa Department and 2 classes in the College Department. The Humanities Department was opened in 1957 and the Science Department in 1970. On the recommendation of the National Education Commission in 1958, the madrasa was abolished in 1962 and the madrasa classes were converted into secondary classes and Dhaka Madrasa became known as the school division of the Islamic Intermediate College. Then in 1968, the school was separated from the college and named Islamia Government
